# Rem the Rat (iOS Mobile App)

## Overview
Our project seeks to aid the average consumer within the kitchen through the process of cooking. There are two separate but dependent working parts in tandem, firstly an iOS app and secondly, a physical component consisting of a rat-like robot with a scale and thermistor probe. The iOS app will be developed in Xcode utilizing Swift. The consumer will be able to navigate through a menu choosing between multiple functions, these functions include scale, thermistor , a timer, a grocery list, and most importantly, recipes. Recipes can be uploaded by the consumer in steps and will be displayed on screen. Using keywords, the app will activate certain features for certain steps. For example if the recipe calls for a certain measurement by weight, the weight mechanism will appear. Then the consumer will be able to use the scale on the robot to weigh, the app will display the weight and inform the user whether it’s  the appropriate amount for the recipe. This feature would work the same for the thermistor probe and timer for their respective steps. 

As mentioned before, the robot consists of a scale and thermistor probe, working in conjunction with hardware inside. The main job of the machine is to take data the user gathers with the components and give it to the app through Bluetooth. It has a stand to hold the phone, with racks to hold cooking utensils and spices. The design is meant to be clean, sturdy and modern. The intent of our project is to ease the messy process of cooking for the average cooking novice to a home cook, it’s not really meant for restaurants and chefs. It should be used for consumers who need help getting into cooking or to be used for its basic features, the scale, thermometer and timer once the consumer gets more comfortable and or do not need to use the recipes feature.
